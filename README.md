# DFE_LQCD

This project implements a conjugate gradient solver for Lattice QCD Problems. 
Currently, only wilson dslash discretization of the dirac operator is supported. 
The arithmetic and the formulization of the dirac operator is based on 
Jefferson Lab's QphIX. The structure of the operator is inspired by 
the imlementation of the hopping matrix in tmLQCD. The code is targeted Maxeler 
MAIA Dataflow Engines. This code is used for research, and is uploaded as is, 
and is not gauranteed to work correctly. In fact, the code is in the early 
stages of the developement.
