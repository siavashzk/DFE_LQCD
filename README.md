# DFE_QPHIX

This is a port of Jefforson Labs' QPhiX package that implements the dirac operator and a conjugate gradient solver for Lattice QCD problems. The code is ported for Maxeler DFEs. This code is used for research, and is uploaded as is, and is not gauranteed to work correctly. In fact, the code is in the early stages of the developement.
